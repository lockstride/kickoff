# Business Brief Input — TestStartup

*Generated: 2026-02-14*

## Problem Statement (Validated)
Small and medium businesses waste 40+ hours per quarter on software evaluation decisions. Teams use ad-hoc spreadsheets, lose stakeholder input, and make gut-feel decisions on $50K+ annual commitments. The result: 35% buyer's remorse within 6 months, hidden assumptions that surface too late, and zero audit trail for compliance or learning.

## Solution Overview
An AI-augmented decision matrix that acts as a cognitive forcing function. Unlike generic spreadsheet templates, it structures evaluation criteria dynamically based on the specific software category, surfaces hidden assumptions through guided questioning, and coordinates async stakeholder input with clear accountability. The output is a self-documenting decision record that serves as both the process tool and the audit trail.

## Target Market
SMB beachhead: cross-functional SaaS evaluation committees (5-15 stakeholders) making their first or second enterprise software purchase in a category. Initial focus on CRM, project management, and marketing automation evaluations where the pain is most acute and the buying committee is well-defined.

## Business Model Hypothesis
Tiered SaaS pricing (specific pricing TBD after validation). Free tier for individual evaluators, paid team tier for collaborative features and stakeholder coordination. Target high ARPU ($200-500/month per team) justified by the cost of bad decisions. Bootstrapped to maintain focus on high-value use cases rather than chasing volume.

## Key Differentiators
1. Simplicity over complexity — reduces cognitive load instead of adding it
2. Built-in stakeholder coordination — async input collection with accountability
3. Self-documenting decisions — the process IS the documentation
4. Learning over time — past evaluations inform future criteria and weightings

## Founder-Market Fit Assessment
15 years of lived pain across technical leadership, product management, and business strategy roles. Has personally led 20+ enterprise software evaluations and experienced the full spectrum of dysfunction. Technical depth to build the product, product instinct to design the UX, and strategic perspective to position it in market.

## Top 3 Risks
1. Adoption friction — teams default to familiar (broken) processes under time pressure
2. GTM noise — crowded productivity/decision-support space makes positioning challenging
3. Well-funded competition — established players (Gartner, G2) could add decision-matrix features

## 90-Day Validation Priorities
1. Build functional MVP with core matrix + stakeholder input workflow
2. Recruit 10 SMB teams for live evaluation pilots
3. Target 3 paid conversions (30% conversion baseline) to validate willingness to pay
