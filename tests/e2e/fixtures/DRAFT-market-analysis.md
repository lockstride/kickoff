# Market Analysis: TestStartup

## Executive Summary

TestStartup is entering the SMB software evaluation market with an AI-augmented decision matrix. The addressable market is substantial, with 6M+ US small businesses spending significant time on unstructured software evaluation processes.

## Market Size

- **TAM**: $2.4B (US business decision-support software)
- **SAM**: $600M (SMB software evaluation tools)
- **SOM**: $30M (first 3 years, 5-50 employee focus)

Methodology: Bottom-up calculation based on 6M US SMBs with 5-50 employees × estimated 30% actively evaluating software annually × $133 average annual spend on evaluation tooling.

## Target Customer

Cross-functional evaluation committees (5-15 stakeholders) at SMBs making enterprise software purchases in CRM, project management, and marketing automation categories. Primary pain: 40+ hours per evaluation cycle spent on ad-hoc spreadsheets with no audit trail.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Gartner/G2 | Brand authority, extensive reviews | Passive research, no decision workflow |
| Spreadsheets | Free, familiar | No structure, no stakeholder coordination |
| Coda/Notion | Flexible templates | Generic, no evaluation-specific intelligence |

## Market Entry Strategy

Focus on the underserved SMB evaluation committee segment where:
- Gartner is too expensive and enterprise-focused
- Spreadsheet templates lack coordination features
- No existing tool combines AI-driven criteria with stakeholder management

## Key Trends

1. Remote/hybrid work increases need for structured async decision processes
2. SaaS proliferation means more frequent evaluation cycles
3. Compliance requirements demand audit trails for procurement decisions
