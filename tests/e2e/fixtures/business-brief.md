# Business Brief: TestStartup

## Executive Summary

TestStartup is building an AI-augmented decision matrix for SMB software evaluations. By structuring the evaluation process and coordinating stakeholder input, TestStartup eliminates the 40+ hours of wasted time, hidden assumptions, and buyer's remorse that plague enterprise software purchases.

## Problem Statement

Small and medium businesses waste significant resources on software evaluation decisions:

- **Decision paralysis**: Ad-hoc spreadsheets and unstructured processes lead to analysis paralysis
- **Hidden assumptions**: Stakeholder biases surface too late, after commitments are made
- **No audit trail**: Decisions lack documentation for compliance, learning, or accountability
- **Stakeholder chaos**: 5-15 person buying committees with no structured coordination

The result: 35% buyer's remorse within 6 months of purchase on $50K+ annual commitments.

## Proposed Solution

An AI-augmented decision matrix that acts as a cognitive forcing function:

1. **Dynamic criteria**: Evaluation criteria generated based on specific software category
2. **Stakeholder coordination**: Async input collection with clear accountability
3. **Self-documenting**: The evaluation process IS the audit trail
4. **Learning system**: Past evaluations inform future criteria and weightings

## Target Market

**Primary segment**: SMB cross-functional evaluation committees (5-15 stakeholders) making enterprise software purchases in CRM, project management, and marketing automation categories.

**Beachhead**: Companies making their first or second evaluation in a category — maximum pain, minimum incumbent tooling.

## Business Model

Tiered SaaS with high ARPU target ($200-500/month per team):
- **Free tier**: Individual evaluators, basic matrix
- **Team tier**: Collaborative features, stakeholder coordination, audit trail
- Bootstrapped to maintain focus on high-value use cases

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness |
|-----------|----------|
| Generic spreadsheets | No structure, no coordination, no learning |
| Gartner/G2 | Research-focused, not process-focused |
| Decision frameworks | Static, no stakeholder coordination |

## Key Differentiators

1. Simplicity over complexity — reduces cognitive load
2. Built-in stakeholder coordination
3. Self-documenting decisions
4. Learning over time from past evaluations

## Risk Assessment

1. **Adoption friction**: Teams default to familiar broken processes under time pressure
2. **GTM noise**: Crowded productivity space makes positioning challenging
3. **Well-funded competition**: Established players could add decision-matrix features

## 90-Day Validation Plan

1. Build functional MVP with core matrix + stakeholder workflow
2. Recruit 10 SMB teams for live evaluation pilots
3. Target 3 paid conversions (30% conversion baseline)
