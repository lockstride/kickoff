- **SAM**: $1.2B (small business segment)
- **SOM**: $50M (first 3 years, 5-50 employee focus)

## Target Customer

Small businesses with 5-50 employees currently using manual expense tracking or basic spreadsheets. Key pain point: 5+ hours/week spent on receipt management.

## Competitive Landscape
