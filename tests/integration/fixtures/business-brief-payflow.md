# Business Brief: PayFlow

## Executive Summary

PayFlow is a fintech startup building real-time B2B payment infrastructure to solve the critical cash flow challenges facing small and medium businesses. By enabling instant invoice settlement, PayFlow eliminates the 30-90 day payment delays that strain SMB operations.

## Problem Statement

Small and medium businesses face a persistent cash flow crisis caused by slow B2B payment cycles:

- **Payment delays**: Average B2B invoice takes 45 days to settle
- **Cash flow strain**: 82% of SMB failures cite cash flow as primary cause
- **Administrative burden**: Manual reconciliation costs 15+ hours/month
- **Financing gap**: Short-term credit to bridge gaps costs 18-24% APR

The pain is acute for businesses with $50K-$10M annual revenue—too small for enterprise treasury solutions, too large for consumer payment apps.

## Proposed Solution

PayFlow provides instant B2B payment rails with three core capabilities:

1. **Instant Settlement**: Invoices paid and settled in seconds, not weeks
2. **Smart Reconciliation**: Automatic matching of payments to invoices
3. **Cash Flow Visibility**: Real-time dashboard showing receivables and payables

The platform integrates with existing accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) and banking relationships, requiring no workflow changes.

## Target Market

**Primary segment**: US-based SMBs with $50K-$10M annual revenue
- 6.1 million businesses in this segment
- Average of $2.4M in annual B2B transactions per business
- Currently underserved by enterprise solutions (too expensive) and consumer apps (lack business features)

**Initial wedge**: Professional services firms (agencies, consultancies) with high invoice volumes and recurring clients.

## Business Model

- **Transaction fees**: 0.5% per instant settlement (vs 2-3% for credit card advances)
- **SaaS subscription**: $99/month for dashboard and integrations
- **Float revenue**: Interest on funds held during settlement window

Target unit economics: $180 LTV with 3-month payback period.

## Market Opportunity

- **TAM**: $1.2T annual B2B payments in SMB segment
- **SAM**: $120B addressable with current product capabilities
- **SOM**: $6B realistic capture in 5 years (5% penetration)

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Position | PayFlow Advantage |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Bill.com | Invoice management, slow settlement | Instant settlement, simpler UX |
| Stripe | Developer-focused, complex | SMB-focused, no-code setup |
| Banks | Trusted, slow, expensive | Speed, lower fees |

## Key Risks

1. **Regulatory**: Money transmission licensing requirements
2. **Fraud**: Real-time payments increase fraud exposure
3. **Network effects**: Value increases with adoption (chicken-and-egg)

## Next Steps

1. Complete money transmission licensing in 5 initial states
2. Launch beta with 50 professional services firms
3. Validate unit economics before Series A
