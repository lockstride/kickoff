## Slide 2: The Problem

### B2B Payments Take 30-90 Days to Settle

Small and medium businesses face a cash flow crisis. While consumer payments are instant, B2B invoices take weeks or months to clear, creating a dangerous gap between delivering value and receiving payment.

**Key Stats:**
- Average B2B invoice takes 45 days to settle
- 82% of SMB failures cite cash flow as primary cause
- Short-term credit to bridge gaps costs 18-24% APR

The market is massive and underserved. Enterprise treasury solutions are too expensive, while consumer payment apps lack business features.

**Why Now:**

- SMBs increasingly digital-first
- Accounting software APIs enable seamless integration
